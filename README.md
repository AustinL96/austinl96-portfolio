# Austin Lewis - Full Stack Developer Portfolio

## Description

This repository contains the self-made Portfolio website using primarily HTML and CSS. Within this website, a potential employer can learn more about me, access some of my projects, and find my contact information if they wish to hire me.

This website was built with attention to being seen on various devices or screens, containing alt descriptors and media queries to resize certain elements.

## Usage
