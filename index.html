                    Hello there, my name is Austin Lewis! I am a Web Developer from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. I don't really have anything to put in here yet, but I plan to have something substantial working here by the end of this course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the meantime, here is a quote because I have nothing better to add yet: "When a man dies before his time, how much is truly lost? More than a life, certainly. A branch withers and bears no more fruit. Futures are erased. Paths close that can never be reopened. Would his offspring be Saints? Killers? Both? When a man dies before his time, the answers go with him. This begs the question: should not all men be saved?"
                </p>
